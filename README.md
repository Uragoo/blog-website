# GHIBLOG: A blog website about Studio Ghibli for a school project
This website is a blog centered around Studio Ghibli. We've created this website in a manner that allows it to have multiple admins, therefore multiple users can post and edit the posts on the blog. Users who have created an account and aren't admins can't post/edit posts however there is a like system allowing users to express appreciation to the blog posts they like.

# Setting up the website:
When coding our website we used XAMPP. You can simply import our database through PHPmyAdmin [the exported database is called ghiblog].
Client :  localhost
PHP version : 5.6.18 
Server version : 5.7.11

Don't forget to change your account name and password for the connection to your database. These modifications take place in app/database/connect.php 

# Useful information
Password used to log into the different accounts in our database: 1234
We tested the website on Microsoft Edge [On PC]

# Things to watch out for
When you choose to edit a blog post you will need to reupload the image
When liking a blog post you can only like it when you're on the home page, it won't work if you're on the post's page
