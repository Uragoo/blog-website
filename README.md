# GHIBLOG: A blog website about Studio Ghibli for a school project
This website is a blog centered around Studio Ghibli. We've created this website in a manner that allows it to have multiple admins, therefore multiple users can post and edit the posts on the blog. Users who have created an account and aren't admins can't post/edit posts however there is a like system allowing users to express appreciation to the blog posts they like.

# Setting up the website:
When coding our website we used XAMPP. You can simply import our database through PHPmyAdmin [the exported database is called ghiblog].
